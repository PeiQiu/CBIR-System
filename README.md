## ImageCompressor

### RLE : `(run length encoding) a lossless encoding scheme in which a sequence of same-colored pixels is store as a single value.`
  * Compression ratio of 4:3
  * Savings ratio of 25%
  
### CAC : `The division of image region into four equal-sized subregions is representd  through a region quadtree`

### DCT :
```
  * Convert to YCbCr color space and subsample in chroma
  * Tile into 8x8 blocks, offset by -128 and take the DCT
  * Quantize the coefficients.  Divide by small numbers in the upper-left of each tile and large numbers in the lower-right. 
```

### Delta compression : `the simplest lossy predictive coding schemes. Recording the approximate error between the predicted and actual samples values.`
